The `src` directory is where the main source code for a Next.js project resides. This directory contains sub-directories that organize the different types of code in the project.

# **Subdirectories**
## **`atoms`**
The `atoms` directory contains [Recoil atoms](https://recoiljs.org/docs/basic-tutorial/atoms) for managing global state in the application. Recoil is a state management library for React that allows developers to manage global state in a more intuitive and efficient way. Atoms are the smallest unit of state in Recoil, and represent a single piece of application state that can be read from and written to by multiple components.

## **`chakra`**
The `chakra` directory manages the global style of the app, as it is built using [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/), a React component library that provides a set of customizable, accessible, and reusable UI components. This directory may contain Chakra theme files and any custom styles or overrides for Chakra UI components.

## **`components`**
The `components` directory contains the UI components used across the application. These components are reusable building blocks that encapsulate the logic and functionality of a particular part of the user interface. Using components in a React project modularizes the codebase, promotes code reuse, and makes it easier to manage and maintain the application.

## **`firebase`**
The `firebase` directory manages the configuration and setup of [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) services for the application. Firebase is a platform that provides a set of tools and services for building and scaling web and mobile applications, including hosting, authentication, real-time database, and more.

## **`hooks`**
The `hooks` directory contains custom [React hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-custom.html) that provide reusable and encapsulated logic for various components. React hooks are functions that allow developers to use React features like state and lifecycle methods in functional components, and can be composed together to build more complex behavior.

## **`pages`**
The `pages` directory contains page routes representing the different pages in the site. Next.js uses the file system as the router, so any `.js`, `.jsx`, `.ts`, or `.tsx` file inside this directory will be treated as a page route. Pages are the building blocks of Next.js applications, and each page is associated with a URL that can be navigated to in the browser.
